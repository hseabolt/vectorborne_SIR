## Project Abstract (UPDATE ME!)

Novel extensions to a published SIR compartment model describing the dynamics of vector-borne disease in a 2-pathogen/1-vector/1-host system are proposed.  
The goals of these model extensions are to analyze the resulting changes to the transmission dynamics of two established pathogens induced by the 
introduction of novel diversity in the form of either a newly emerged (i.e. competing) pathogen or the expansion of the pathogensâ€™ ecological niche
 to new vectors and new hosts.  While our proposed model extensions are theoretical by design, we aim to derive plausible initial values gleaned from 
 real-world case studies of applicable vector-borne model systems in an effort to demonstrate realistic parameter ranges that may underly similar 
 biological systems as they occur in nature.  Extended epidemic models such as those included in this proposal have potential to become valuable tools in 
 the public health science toolbox by helping scientists and decision-makers evaluate threats posed by -for example- the emergence of new vector-borne 
 pathogens or by the expansion of  the host or geographic range of established pathogens due to climate change.
